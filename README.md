# RoboticArmWithBluetooth
INTELLIGENT ROBOTIC ARM CONTROLLED BY MOBILE APP VIA BLUETOOH 

The robot arm designed and realized in the project has can move in 4 axis directions with 5 DC motors. The holder, it can take a desired material from one place and move it to another. While doing this process, stm32 and Bluetooth module connected to Arduino Robot control is provided by connecting to the application.
