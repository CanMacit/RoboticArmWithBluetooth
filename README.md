# RoboticArmWithBluetooth
INTELLIGENT ROBOTIC ARM CONTROLLED BY MOBILE APP VIA BLUETOOH 

The robot arm designed and realized in the project has can move in 4 axis directions with 5 DC motors. The holder, it can take a desired material from one place and move it to another. While doing this process, stm32 and Bluetooth module connected to Arduino Robot control is provided by connecting to the application. In addition, with the catch button in the application, it can catch an object that is not determined. 


Here is the video of the robotic arm in action:
